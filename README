Long enough ago that the html structure has probably changed, a good
friend of mine asked if I'd help convert a portion of the 
Electronic Code of Federal Regulations into a Windows Compiled HTML
(chm) file for his personal reference. This code  performs that task,
and can also be used to extract data tables for presentation in a more
convenient form.
